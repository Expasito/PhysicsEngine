# PhysicsEngine

This will be a (hopefully) fully finished physics engine when complete. Most of the structure for the engine is developed, but the formulas and visuals are still on the way. The main goal of this is to be able to test and add different physics features over time while visualizing the entities moving. 

Goals:<br>
Bodies: Rigidbody and Softbody along with transforms for those(like rotation, compression) <br>
Colliders: box, sphere and mesh<br>
Springs: maybe, if we get an ode working well using rk4<br>
